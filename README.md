# Rule Engine and Weather Monitoring System

## Description
This project consists of a Rule Engine that evaluates user eligibility based on predefined rules using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It also includes a Real-Time Weather Data Processing System that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and aggregates it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 11 or higher
- Eclipse IDE or any Java IDE of your choice
- Maven (optional, for dependency management)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avinash-23-s/RuleEngineWeatherMonitoring.git

## Usage
1. Run the `Main` class to test the Rule Engine.
2. For the Weather Monitoring System, implement the necessary API calls and data processing as described in the assignment.

## Features
- AST for dynamic rule evaluation.
- Real-time weather data retrieval and aggregation.
- Alerts for specified weather conditions.

## Non-functional Items
- Security measures include input validation for user data.
- Performance optimizations in data retrieval and processing.

## Testing
Tested using sample data and verified rule evaluations for correctness.
